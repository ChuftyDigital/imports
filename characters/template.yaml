# AI INFLUENCER CHARACTER TEMPLATE
# ============================================================================
# This template defines every attribute needed to generate consistent,
# realistic character imagery. Each field maps directly to prompt tokens
# injected into the generation pipeline.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to roster/<character_id>.yaml
# 2. Fill in ALL fields — empty fields will produce generic results
# 3. Be SPECIFIC — "honey blonde with subtle strawberry highlights"
#    is far better than "blonde"
# 4. Cross-reference across characters to ensure roster diversity
